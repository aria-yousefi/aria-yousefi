MS Computer Science @ University of Florida  
Background in Architectural Design  

I build software systems that interact with the physical world — from IoT sensor networks to civic reporting platforms and real-time data pipelines.

## Featured Projects

### Pave — Civic Issue Reporting Platform
Full-stack 311-style reporting system focused on improving how residents report infrastructure issues.

- React + React Native frontend
- Flask backend API
- Image-based issue reporting workflow
- YOLO-based classification pipeline (in progress)
- Location tagging + structured report generation

Designed as a scalable foundation for modernizing city service request systems.

### Construction Site IoT Monitoring System
End-to-end environmental monitoring system for active construction sites.

- LoRa sensor nodes
- Raspberry Pi edge gateway
- MQTT broker for real-time ingestion
- Supabase + AWS-backed data storage
- React dashboard for live visualization

Built to collect, stream, store, and visualize real-time environmental sensor data in production-like conditions.

### GNV Events — Event Aggregation API
Backend service that scrapes, normalizes, and serves structured event data.

- Golang (Gin)
- Colly-based scraping
- OCR microservice integration (Python)
- NLP-based deduplication
- RESTful API design

Designed to aggregate fragmented event data into a clean, queryable API.

---

## Technical Focus

- Full-stack development (React, Flask, Go, Node)
- Real-time systems (MQTT, WebSockets)
- IoT data pipelines
- RESTful API architecture
- Applied computer vision workflows
- Cloud deployment (AWS, Supabase)
